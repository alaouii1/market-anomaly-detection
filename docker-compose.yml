# =============================================================
# WHAT THIS DOES:
# =============================================================
# 
# 1. Uses official Jupyter image with scipy (includes pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)
# 
# 2. Maps port 8888 - you'll access Jupyter at http://localhost:8888
# 
# 3. Mounts current folder (.) to /home/jovyan/work inside container
#    - Your data/raw/ folder will be accessible
#    - Your notebooks/ folder will be accessible
#    - Any file you create in Jupyter is saved to your actual project folder
# 
# 4. Sets a simple password: "anomaly" (instead of random token)
# 
# =============================================================
# HOW TO USE:
# =============================================================
# 
# 1. Put this file in your project root (market-anomaly-detection/)
# 
# 2. Start Jupyter:
#    docker-compose up
# 
# 3. Open browser:
#    http://localhost:8888
# 
# 4. Enter password:
#    anomaly
# 
# 5. Navigate to work/ folder - that's your project
# 
# 6. To stop:
#    Ctrl+C in terminal, then: docker-compose down
